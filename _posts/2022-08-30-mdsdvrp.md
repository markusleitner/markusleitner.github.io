The paper **Multi-depot routing with split deliveries: Models and a branch-and-cut algorithm** co-authored with Luis Gouveia (University of Lisbon) and Mario Ruthmair (Gurobi Optimization) has been accepted for publication in the journal Transportation Science (a preprint can be found on [optimization online](https://optimization-online.org/2021/10/8658/). In this work, we study the **multi-depot split-delivery vehicle routing problem (MDSDVRP)** which has been introduced by D. Gulczynski, B. Golden, and E. Wasil in 2011. The MDSDVRP offers a potential to increase the efficiency of (last-mile) delivery and additional cost-savings by combining deliveries from multiple origins (depots) with the opportunity to satisfy individual customer demands by more than one vehicle (split-delivery). 

In our paper we propose a new mathematical (mixed-integer) programming formulation for the MDSDVRP that uses several new families of inequalities We also study theoretical properties of the newly introduced inequalities and use the obtained results to design and implement the first exact solution algorithm for the MDSDVRP. The results of our extensive computational study also show that our algorithm is competitive to state-of-the-art algorithms for a problem variant with a single depot (the well-known split-delivery vehicle routing problem) and significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method in case demands of individual customers must be satisfied by single vehicles (the multi-depot traveling salesperson problem).
